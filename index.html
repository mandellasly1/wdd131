        <p> Nigeria, located in West Africa, is Africa's most populous country with over 220 million people. It shares borders with Benin, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon, and has a southern coastline along the Gulf of Guinea. 
            The country is made up of 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, with Abuja as the capital and Lagos as its largest city. Home to hundreds of ethnic groups, including the Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo, 
            Nigeria is linguistically diverse, though English is the official language. It operates as a federal presidential republic, with Bola Ahmed Tinubu serving as president since May 2023. 
            Nigeria's economy is one of the largest in Africa, driven by oil, agriculture, telecommunications, and services. Despite its vast resources, it faces challenges such as poverty and infrastructure gaps. 
            Culturally, Nigeria is influential worldwide, especially through its music, fashion, literature, and Nollywood film industry.</p>
